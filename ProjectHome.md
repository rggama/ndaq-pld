NDAQ is a 8 channels digitizer and 8 channels time to digital converter. It also has 8 built in signal discriminators. Its main purpose is as a VME module but may be operated in a standalone mode through USB communication. The module has a CAN port for system calibration, monitoring and debugging. The system is based on programmable logic devices and contains two FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array). This project is the hardware description of the logic behavior for both FGPAs, developed using the VHDL language.
